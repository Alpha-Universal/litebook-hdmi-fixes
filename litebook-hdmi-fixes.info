This info file is included within litebook-hdmi-fixes_*_all.deb, and details 
how to use the following scripts:

/etc/litebook-scripts/scripts/hdmi/litebook-hdmi-setup.sh
/etc/litebook-scripts/scripts/hdmi/litebook-hdmi-start.sh
/etc/litebook-scripts/scripts/hdmi/litebook-hdmi-stop.sh
/etc/litebook-scripts/scripts/hdmi/litebook-hdmi-adjuster.sh

Several template files are also included in this deb, but they shouldn't be 
edited in any way, as the above scripts will modify them as needed, and 
misplaced edits can break X.

### PURPOSE AND CAPABILITIES ### 
################################

As of late May 2017, the Litebook's Intel HD 400 integrated graphics is incapable 
of automatically outputting an HDMI signal.  The reason why is unknown, but until 
a proper upstream fix is made, this interim fix manually enables HDMI for the 
Litebook (and feasibly for any other Intel HD 400 device).  

These scripts are able to:

    * Install multiple monitors
    * Work for any single user logged in, no matter their user ID
    * Enable highly dynamic monitor configuration 
    * Respect graphical security measures and existing Litebook display configurations

These scripts cannot:

	* Allow HDMI monitors to be configured through system settings GUIs
	* Automatically configure monitors and enable/disable HDMI output
	* Be run automatically on login (planned feature)
	

################################
#### INSTALLATION AND USAGE ####
################################

These scripts must be run in a specific order, which is:

    cd /etc/litebook-scripts/scripts/hdmi
    sudo ./litebook-hdmi-setup.sh
    sudo reboot
    ./litebook-hdmi-start.sh
    ./litebook-hdmi-adjuster.sh

litebook-hdmi-setup.sh is the _only_ script that requires sudo privileges, and 
litebook-hdmi-adjuster.sh is optional, but will almost certainly need to be run
to fix overscan/underscan problems.


################################
####### POST-SETUP INFO ########
################################

After running litebook-hdmi-setup.sh and litebook-hdmi-start.sh, the startup script 
for your configured monitor will be installed in ~/bin/litebook/.  Simply execute 
this script after every reboot to initialize HDMI output.  You won't need to run 
litebook-hdmi-setup.sh or litebook-hdmi-start.sh anymore, unless you want to 
set up additional monitors.

A script called litebook-hdmi-stop is also installed in ~/bin/litebook/, which is 
needed to terminate all HDMI output.  If you unplug your HDMI monitor and don’t 
run this script, the system will behave as if the HDMI output were _still_ enabled 
(i.e. programs opening in the missing screen, mouse running off the Litebook’s 
screen, etc).

If you’ve enabled HDMI and are plugging your Litebook into a TV, then before 
running litebook-hdmi-adjuster.sh, go into your TV’s options menu and adjust the 
aspect ratio there.  Different manufacturers call this menu option different 
things, so be sure to search for Aspect, Theater Settings, Widescreen Settings, 
or etc.


################################
######### KNOWN ISSUES #########
################################

When running litebook-hdmi-adjuster.sh, there is a small chance that the system 
will crash after running too many consecutive transformations.  This happened to 
me twice out of 40+ transforms (which I was running in very quick succession, 
something that my adjuster script rate-limits to a degree).  

If this happens to you, hit control+alt+F1, log into the TTY, and execute this: 
sudo systemctl restart lightdm.service.
